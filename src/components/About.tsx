I'm a Research & Data Science leader who blends evidence and empathy to help companies focus on what matters most. At Intercom, I lead Team RAD—a brilliant mix of AI-forward researchers and data scientists who use qualitative and quantitative methods to inform decision-making, fuel product innovation, and shape more intelligent, human-centered experiences.

Before Intercom, I spent 8 years in scientific research labs - Yahoo and Telefónica - leading teams of scientists and conducting research of my own at the intersection of human-computer interaction, AI, and mobile computing. My research helped power products like Yahoo Mobile Search, Flurry, Aviate, and Gemini. I have a PhD in Computer Science from UCD, a strong technical background, and have published over 30 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier conferences and journals across human computer interaction, mobile computing, information retrieval and recommender systems.

In 2017 I founded HER+Data, a community supporting women in analytics and data science. Over nearly eight years, we built a community of &gt; 1000 people, hosted 36 events, featured 80+ speakers, and created an empowering space where women found their voice, built skills, and supported each other's growth. HER+Data Dublin came to a close in 2025 - a bittersweet but intentional decision. I'm deeply proud of the space we built together.

I care about building products that solve actual problems, nurturing happy, high-performing teams, and sharing what I've learned along the way. You'll find me writing, speaking, or mentoring in spaces where research, data science, leadership, AI and impact meet.

            I'm Irish and live in Dublin, Ireland with my husband, two kids, and a chocolate Labrador. I've lived in London, Barcelona and San Francisco. I'm a big foodie, amateur baker, obsessed with most forms of craft, and a fan of lifting heavy weights and good red wine.
