            I'm a Research and Data Science leader who loves building great teams, and using data and evidence to drive effective decision making and inform product innovation. I lead the Research, Analytics & Data Science (RAD) team at Intercom where I've been based for the past ~8 years. We're on a mission to drive effective, evidence-based decisions using research and data science. We believe in the power of combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to drive product direction, shape company strategy, and gain a holistic understanding of our customers and business.

            Before Intercom, I spent 8 years in industrial research labs — Yahoo Labs and Telefonica Research — leading teams of scientists and conducting research of my own focused on understanding, mining and modeling mobile user behaviours with a view to a shaping new product innovation. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and have published 50 peer reviewed papers at top-tier conferences in areas like human computer interaction, mobile computing, information retrieval and recommender systems.
